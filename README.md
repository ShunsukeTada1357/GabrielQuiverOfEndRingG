　For a quiver 1→2→3→4→5, we write End(G)'s irreducible morphism. In this special setting, the Gabriel quiver of End(G) is the same as path algebra of the quiver 1→2→3→4→5 up to opposite.  
<br>
Note that the picture below writes only irreducible morphisms of End(G), so there is no information about some relations.

(i)I wnat to fix that graph's position changes everytime.
